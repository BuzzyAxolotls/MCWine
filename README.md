# MCWine

MCWine is a fabric-based modpack designed to bring better performance, brand new fixes, more accessibility and a compatibility system to allow players to connect to newer & older servers out of the box.

## Installing this modpack (Official/Vanilla Method)

1. [**Click here to download the development version,**](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine/archive/refs/heads/Dev.zip)
2. Open your Minecraft folder,
3. Open the zip file you have downloaded from step one,
4. Copy the MCWine-XXXX folder from ZIP to .minecraft/versions folder, if asked - replace the files,
5. Restart your minecraft launcher,
6. Create a new installation instance by heading to "Installations" and choosing the + icon,
7. Choose the version "MCWine-XXXX" from versions list which should be on the top,
8. Change the game directory from default to .minecraft/versions/MCWine-XXXX folder,
9. Make sure the new instance has java 16 or greater selected from the "more options" page,
10. Save the instance and attempt to run the instance.

## Installing this modpack (MultiMC Method)

1. [**Click here to download the development version,**](https://github.com/Kichura/MCWine/archive/refs/heads/MultiMC-Dev.zip)
2. Drag the ZIP into the MultiMC window,
3. Make sure the installed instance has Java 17 or greater installed.

## Updating Java Version (Optional)

It is recommended that you use [Java 18](https://jdk.java.net/18) to allow minecraft to make use of the latest java version.

*Although now requires ```javacheck.jar``` to be deleted as seen in this [clip](https://streamable.com/i3voeu). (But if you use MultiMC instead then skip the ```javacheck.jar``` removal requirement)*

## JVM Arguments (Optional)

It is recommended that you use [one of these specific scripts](https://pastebin.com/raw/wZrDGjFs) from this pastebin as your JVM arguments instead of the defaults. 

*(You can change the ```-Xmx2G``` including ```-Xms2G``` value from the pastebin in order to manage the game RAM on how much to use for Minecraft, But depends on your computer's hardware; Both of those are not needed in MultiMC however as it uses it's own configurators for that)*
