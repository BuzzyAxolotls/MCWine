# MCWine
A fabric-based client designed to connect to older servers on the go including bypass the annoying "HackedServer" plugin's brand-checking system, It also uses it's own mods in order to change the performance system of Minecraft's API such as video graphics and world-related contents.


# Can i use a software rendering for this client?
You can use Mesa3D to play with this client at anytime, However it is recommended to set specific video settings to off to avoid unwanted lags on your low-end computer or if you are planning to game during safe modes.


# Is this client compatible with older servers?
You can use MCWine to connect to older servers by using the direct connect function or the add server function and then changing the server's version that it uses or you can leave it as "auto" to let the client mimic a version for you when joining it.


# Do you own any of the mod products yourself?
I did not make any products involved for MCWine as it is by default a modpack aswell just like RLcraft and many other projects.
