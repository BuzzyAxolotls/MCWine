MrMangoHands for helping out with sharing the lithium configuration codes,
LoganDark for telling me how to resolve the version string issue for "vanilla" context in F3.


If you need help and support from one of the broken mods;
Please contact the original authors at github or their discord servers for more details instead of me (Kichura) as i do NOT own any of the following mods as said above.

Additional note: This modpack is NOT for forge nor is the main jar a mod itself, Meaning you will have to copy over all files to a seperate version profile instead,
An example image on how the profile is properly installed: https://i.imgur.com/VNBtQJJ.png
