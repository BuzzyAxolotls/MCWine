If you need help and support from one of the broken mods; Please contact the original authors at github or their discord servers for more details instead of me (Kichura) as i do not own any of the following mods as said above.

Additional note: This modpack is NOT for forge nor is the main jar a mod itself, Meaning you will have to copy over all files to a seperate version profile instead.
